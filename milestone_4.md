# Milestone Report 4

## Major Changes
No major changes

## What I Have Accomplished Since My Last Meeting
I generated more plots of the FastTCP flows and continued to look for patterns. In addition, I read [this paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.436.8753&rep=rep1&type=pdf) about FastTCP. I tried to figure out how Fast TCP adjusts its window size, but the formula was a bit too complicated to fully understand. 

## Meeting My Milestone
My milestone for this week was to see more patterns and to read the paper. I did generate more graphs and saw more patterns. I also picked up a few clues about how the congestion window changes size from reading the paper, so I believe I met my milestone. I will need to dig deeper to figure out exactly how the size of the congestion window is determined. I am also going to read the Fast TCP section in [this book](http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current/html/newtcps.html#fast-tcp), since it is easier to understand than the paper.  

## Surprises
No surprises

## Looking Ahead
Over the next two weeks, I would like to better understand how the congestion window size is determined. Since the formula is a bit complicated, I plan to write a simple simulator so that I can tweak the parameters of the formula and see how the window size changes.  

## Revisions to My Future Milestones
I think my future milestones are reasonable right now. Depending on how much I can understand about Fast TCP window resizing from my simulator, I might need to update my milestones later. 

## Resources Needed
I have all the resources I need.
