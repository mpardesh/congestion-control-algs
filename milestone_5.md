# Milestone Report 5

## Major Changes
No major changes

## What I Have Accomplished Since My Last Meeting
I wrote a simple simulator to help me understand how FastTCP changes its window size. Using my simulator, I was able to tweak the parameters and replicate some of the graphs I saw in my experiments. I started with the parameters I saw in [this textbook](http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current/html/newtcps.html#fast-tcp) and adjusted them until my graphs looked similar to the ones in my experiment. My graphs had roughly the same shape, but were perfectly smooth, while the graphs from the experiment had some noise. 

## Meeting My Milestone
My goal for this week was to finish coding my simulator, so I would say I met my milestone. After coding my simulator, I feel that I have a much better understanding of FastTCP.    

## Surprises
No surprises

## Looking Ahead
Over the next two weeks, I would like to figure out why the graphs in my experiments appear noisy and to replicate as many FastTCP graphs as I can. My next long-term goal for this project is to predict when Akamai's congestion control algorithm uses FastTCP and when it uses other CCAs. My group believes that Akamai uses a proprietary version of FastTCP that is slightly different from the published one. I would also like to find the differences between the published FastTCP and Akamai's FastTCP.    

## Revisions to My Future Milestones
I think my future milestones are reasonable right now. 

## Resources Needed
I have all the resources I need.
