# Milestone Report

## Major Changes 
No major changes.

## What I Have Accomplished So Far 
So far, I have learned how to request servers, configure the machines, run and extend experiments, and interpret graphs. I have figured out how to tweak different parameters like delay and probability of packet loss. I have also learned some theory about how networks and congestion control algorithms work. I have been able to make graphs that show time vs % of queue filled, like this one:

Graphs like this show traffic patterns seen by different congestion control algorithms and give hints as to which algorithm the web site is using. This graph shows the traffic patterns for https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-macosx10.6.pkg. It looks like this website uses the TCP Cubic congestion control algorithm.   

## Meeting My Milestone 
My original first milestone was to be able to run experiments and produce graphs like the one above. I have also learned how to change the experiment parameters and run controlled experiments. I have a list of URLs that I plan to run experiments on. These URLs are believed to use the Akamai congestion control algorithm. I have achieved my milestone. 

## Surprises 
We use servers from UW Madison and sometimes there aren’t enough machines available. There isn’t much we can do about this. I just need to make sure I start experiments early enough to avoid being stuck without machines at the last minute. 

## Revisions to 15-400 Milestones 
The original milestones seem reasonable so I haven’t made any changes. I have received an additional assignment from my professor, though. She would like me to complete a new assignment that she is writing for her networking class to see if it’s reasonable. This shouldn’t affect my ability to achieve my milestones, since most of it will have to be finished before the spring semester.  

## Resources Needed 
I have all the resources I need.
