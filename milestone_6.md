# Milestone Report 6

## Major Changes
No major changes

## What I Have Accomplished Since My Last Meeting
I produced more plots of the window size of FastTCP with different network conditions. I downloaded files from more websites so I would have more plots to observe. My last round of plots didn't have enough websites and it was hard to find patterns in the graphs. I'm hoping that adding more websites will make patterns more obvious.   

## Meeting My Milestone
My goal for this week was to finish running all my experiments. Since I'm done with my experiments, the next step will be to sort them by increasing bottleneck bandwidth, round trip time, and queue size. I sorted my last round of plots by a quantity called "bandwidth delay product," a magic number in networking but I wasn't able to see any interesting patterns as BDP increased. I hope that by sorting based on individual parameters, the patterns will be more obvious.    

## Surprises
No surprises

## Looking Ahead
My next milestone is to sort the new plots by increasing bottleneck bandwidth, round trip time, and queue size. I will then look for patterns in the graphs. My goal is to use the patterns to make a state diagram that explains the behavior of Akamai's FastTCP. 

## Revisions to My Future Milestones
I think my future milestones are reasonable right now. 

## Resources Needed
I have all the resources I need.
