# Milestone Report 2

## Major Changes
No major changes

## What I Have Accomplished Since My Last Meeting
I have become more familiar with the codebase and experiment setup. I have also started to produce plots of the send patterns of FastTCP with different network conditions. The way we run our experiments has changed a bit since last semester, so I have also been getting used to the new setup and tweaking some of the setup code.  

## Meeting My Milestone
By Februrary 1, I was planning to produce a graph of FastTCP's send pattern and to experiment with different network conditions. So far, I have produced one graph with control settings and have produced several others with slightly different round trip times, bottleneck bandwidths, drop rates, and queue sizes. I have performed about half of experiments that I originally planned, but I will probably need to look at the results and do more experiments in the future. I have met my milestone.  

## Surprises
No surprises, but aside from my research project I have also been helping test a new assignment for Dr. Sherry's class (15-441).

## Looking Ahead
Over the next two weeks, I plan to finish running my experiments and to start formulating a theory as to how FastTCP works. If I am not able to reach a conclusion using the results of my current experiments, I may need to perform more experiments with different network conditions.

## Revisions to My Future Milestones
I think my future milestones are reasonable right now. Depending on the results of my experiments, I might need to update my milestones later. 

## Resources Needed
I have all the resources I need.
